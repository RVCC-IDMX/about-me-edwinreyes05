                <p>Hello! I'm Edwin, a college student on a journey through the exciting realm of web development. My days are a mix of classes, coding challenges, and the pursuit of knowledge in the digital landscape.</p>

                <p>As I navigate the complexities of college life, I find joy in unraveling the mysteries of code and creating engaging web experiences. The process of turning ideas into functional websites is both challenging and immensely rewarding.</p>
        
                <p>When I'm not immersed in my coding adventures, you'll likely find me exploring new coffee spots, sharing laughs with friends, or capturing moments on campus. I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity, and I'm always eager to learn and grow.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soccer Enthusiast:</strong> When I'm not buried in textbooks, you'll find me kicking it on the soccer field with friends. Soccer is my go-to stress buster, and I never miss a chance to score a goal or two.</li>
                <li><strong>Gaming Aficionado:</strong> Now, let's talk gaming. I'm that friend who's always up for a gaming night. Whether it's conquering virtual worlds or battling it out in a strategy game, count me in!</li>
                <li><strong>Road Trip Explorer:</strong> Weekends are for road trips. Exploring new places, trying out local food joints, and creating memories on the highway — that's my idea of a perfect weekend.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics Fanatic:</strong> Surprisingly, I have a thing for math. Solving equations and tackling math problems might sound nerdy, but I find it oddly satisfying. It's like cracking a secret code!</li>
                <li><strong>Lego Architect:</strong> When it's time to unwind, I turn to Legos. Building intricate structures and letting my imagination run wild is my creative escape. It's like my mini world of possibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Music Maestro:</strong> Music fuels my days. From coding to chilling, my playlist is as diverse as my interests. Got any music recommendations? I'm all ears!</li>

            <h2>Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>18 August.--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--</p>

                <p>"My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up Geordie." As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:--</p>
                
                <p>"I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here in this spot--I don't know why, for I was afraid of something--I don't know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you."</p>
